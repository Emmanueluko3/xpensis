How XPensis was Built:

XPensis started its development journey with a meticulous design phase, harnessing the collaborative power of Figma to craft an appealing and user-friendly interface. The core development of XPensis relied on Next.js, a React framework recognized for its speed and adaptability and was hosted on outerbase. Technologies used to build XPensis are highlighted as follows:

Outerbase:
Outerbase is an interface for databases, We selected Outerbase as our database, server and hosting platform for several reasons. Outerbase's serverless architecture perfectly complemented our choice of Next.js, enabling us to create SQLITE database, deploy commands with ease and ensure scalability to accommodate a growing user base.

Outerbase command: In the dynamic landscape of web development, finding efficient solutions for database management is crucial. Recently, I explored the powerful capabilities of Outerbase Commands to seamlessly integrate database operations into my Next.js application.

Outerbase plugins:
Inventory: Inventory plugin is a private plugin that allows us to manage and visualise Xpensis as an admin.

Cloudinary for Image Storage:
Efficient image storage is integral to XPensis, as users may wish to attach receipts or images to their expense entries. Cloudinary proved to be a reliable and flexible solution for managing and serving images. Its powerful image optimization capabilities help maintain app performance while delivering an exceptional user experience.

Cron Jobs for Task Scheduling:
To enhance XPensis's functionality, we incorporated cron jobs for task scheduling. These scheduled jobs automate critical processes within the app, such as sending bill payment reminders and generating financial reports. This ensures that users receive timely notifications and have access to up-to-date financial insights.

Limitations of the project:

1. Limited Live Wallet Testing: During this building/testing phase, we couldn't employ a live wallet funding method since users will understandably be reluctant to risk their money at this stage. Instead, we utilized a dummy wallet funding method for testing purposes.

2. Cron Job Restrictions: Vercel, our hosting provider, offers only two free Cron jobs, and expanding this functionality requires that we subscribe to a premium version. Consequently, we were constrained in implementing Cron jobs solely for weekly and daily goals, leaving out monthly and yearly goal functionalities due to the current limitations."

Whatâ€™s next for XPensis?:

1. Mobile App Development: While XPensis currently operates as a Progressive Web App (PWA), we are considering developing native mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms. This can significantly expand your user base and offer a more tailored mobile experience.

2. Multi-Currency Support: For now the app primarily targets users in Nigeria and Africa, we look forward to adding multi-currency support that may be beneficial for users dealing with various currencies, especially in regions with international transactions.

3. Integration with Financial Institutions: Enable users to link their bank accounts and credit cards for automatic transaction import. This streamlines expense tracking and reduces manual data entry.

4. Card Issuance and Payment: Offer users the option to apply for and manage debit or credit cards through the app. This feature will streamline the payment process and provide users with a one-stop financial management solution.

5. Advanced Reporting: Enhance the app's analytics and reporting capabilities. Provide users with detailed insights into their spending habits, trends, and financial goals.

6. AI-Powered Insights: Implement artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to provide personalised financial recommendations and insights based on users' spending patterns.

7. Expense Sharing: Enable users to split expenses and share them with others, ideal for group outings or shared living situations.

8. Localized Content: Offer localized content and support for different languages and regional financial practices to cater to a broader international audience.

9. User Feedback: Continuously gather user feedback and reviews to identify pain points and areas for improvement, and use this information to prioritize updates and feature additions.

10. Education and Resources: Provide educational resources, articles, and tools to help users improve their financial literacy and make more informed financial decisions.

11. Partnerships: Explore partnerships with financial institutions or fintech companies to offer additional financial products or services to your users.

Conclusion:
XPensis is more than just a financial tool; it's a practical solution for individuals seeking financial stability, personal empowerment, and the ability to make informed decisions about their money. In an ever-changing financial landscape, this app is a valuable asset that offers real-world benefits to users from all walks of life.
